#Mini Banking project

Simulate a minimal but realistic banking system with microservices, where users (customers) can:
	•	Register and manage their profile
	•	Open bank accounts
	•	Transfer money between accounts
	•	Receive notifications after operations

Each microservice has a clear role, communicates with others via REST or events, and is independently testable and deployable.
